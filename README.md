## Project Description

Our project aims to give an art interactive experience in pictures databases. A user is invited to strike a pose in front of a camera. ONce the picture is taken, we will try to match the users position with a similar one in the databased created, a displayed it on screen. Informations will be displayed about the matched painting or picture. The purpose is twofolds. First, it's an interactive browsing exeprience, that involve the visitor in the exhibition directly. With his actions, the image that it diplayes is different. It beaks linearity, observable in traditional art exhibitons. Second, the images presented would maybe never have been found otherwise than through this body interaction. We offer a new tool to experience srendipity.

## Roadmap

## General Roadmap
### Project Developement
- [x] First discussions to define project
- [x] Project presentation with core ideas and pipeline
- [x] Review of existing similar projects
- [x] Begin prototyping
- [x] Find a pose matching technology
- [x] Download Rijks Museum Dataset
- [x] Test different pose matching technologies
- [x] Prototype for User interface
- [x] Protoype for image segmentation
- [x] Second presentation with a Minimal Viable Product
- [x] Decision to focus on scalability
- [ ] Meeting to discuss about the next steps including:

###### Experience :
- [ ] Decisions about VR use
- [ ] Define  possible interactions for the user
- [ ] Decisions the users navigation possibilites after best match
- [ ] Bowsing Experience or just matching ?
- [ ] Define possible users controls
- [ ] Define incentives, what do we invite the person to do ?
- [ ] If headset, should we have a screen showing what happening
- [ ] If other technology, how could the user could 'save' his findings, or his match ?
- [ ] What do we espect as poses ?
- [ ] Wider range of poses or more precise poses ?

###### Developement :
- [ ] Decisions about the design of final UI, esthetic
- [ ] Decisions about the Database needed
- [ ] Decisions about the Metadata needed
- [ ] What technology will be used for final experience ?
- [ ] What is used to take a picture
- [ ] How the picture is transmitted to the UI ?
- [ ] Define incentives, what do we invite the person to do ?
- [ ] Should we interlink some API for a wider experience ?

###### Next :
- [ ] Catch-up with teacher after vacations
- [ ] Get an evolved prototype
- [ ] Test with real pictures
- [ ] Update this list
